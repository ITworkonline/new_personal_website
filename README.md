## Motivation to build a new peersonal website: 
Because the github page has a lot of restriction, I decide to build a new personal website. 
## Platform, frameworks, languages:  
Heroku 

## Ideal website(key feature): 
This personal website will contain four main pages: About, Project, Research, Reading, Photography(call Unsplash API to load the photos I took). 
- In About page, it will present the contact information, briefly introduction, stack I used, and my recently updates.  
- In Project page, it will present my recently projects. The list should be a chronolgical table. Also, the project should be searchable and classable.  
- In Research and Reading page, it should be the same structure as the Project page.
- In Photography page, it will present my photography product. 
- Future work: Demo page: it can demo the project I done.
